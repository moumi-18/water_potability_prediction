<div style="color:black; float:left; width:50%">
<p>Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective <br> policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional <br> and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can<br> yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs <br> outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>pH value: PH is an important parameter in evaluating the acidâ€“base balance of water. It is also<br> the indicator of acidic or alkaline condition of water status</li>
  <br>
  <li>Hardness: The capacity of water to precipitate soap caused by Calcium and Magnesium. The <br> length of time water is in contact with hardness producing material helps determine how much <br> hardness there is in raw water</li>
  <br>  
  <li>TDS: Water has the ability to dissolve a wide range of inorganic and some organic minerals or <br> salts such as potassium, calcium, sodium, bicarbonates, chlorides, magnesium, sulfates etc. These <br> minerals produced un-wanted taste and diluted color in appearance of water.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Chloramines: Chloramines are most commonly formed when ammonia is added to chlorine to <br> treat drinking water.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Sulfate: Sulfates are naturally occurring substances that are found in minerals, soil, and rocks.<br> They are present in ambient air, groundwater, plants, and food. The principal commercial use of <br> sulfate is in the chemical industry. Sulfate concentration in seawater is about 2,700 milligrams<br> per liter (mg/L). It ranges from 3 to 30 mg/L in most freshwater supplies</li>
  <br>
  <li>Electrical Conductivity: Increase in ions concentration enhances the electrical conductivity of <br> water. Generally, the amount of dissolved solids in water determines the electrical conductivity. Electrical conductivity (EC) actually measures the ionic process of a solution that enables it to<br> transmit current.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Total Organic_carbon: Total Organic Carbon (TOC) in source waters comes from decaying<br> natural organic matter (NOM) as well as synthetic sources. TOC is a measure of the total amount<br> of carbon in organic compounds in pure water. </li>
  <br>
  <li>Trihalomethanes: THMs are chemicals which may be found in water treated with chlorine. The<br> concentration of THMs in drinking water varies according to the level of organic material in the<br> water, the amount of chlorine required to treat the water, and the temperature of the water that is<br> being treated.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Turbidity: The turbidity of water depends on the quantity of solid matter present in the suspended<br> state. It is a measure of light emitting properties of water and the test is used to indicate the<br> quality of waste discharge with respect to colloidal matter. </li>
